# 🏦 Bank Management System

A Java-based console application that simulates core banking operations such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and PIN-based authentication. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while managing customer accounts.

## ✨ Features

✅ Create a new account with personal details (Name, DOB, Area Code, etc.)
✅ Secure login using PIN authentication 🔑
✅ Deposit money 💰
✅ Withdraw money (with balance and limit validations) 💸
✅ Check available balance 📊
✅ Display account holder details 👤
✅ Search account using account number 🔍
